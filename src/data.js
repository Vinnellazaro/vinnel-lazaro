    descriptions:`I’m Vinnel Lazaro, a front-end developer with a Bachelor’s in Computer Science from San Sebastian College. My journey in tech has been fueled by a passion for design and usability, driving me to create web applications that are not only visually appealing but also highly functional and user-friendly.

Currently, I work as a Package Development Senior Analyst at Accenture, where I resolve complex Salesforce configurations and collaborate with diverse teams. My previous role as a Front-End Developer allowed me to focus on transforming user experiences through responsive designs using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I thrive on solving design challenges and ensuring that each project meets the highest standards of usability.

What draws me to front-end development is the perfect blend of creativity and technical skill. I love crafting interactive interfaces that engage users while solving real-world problems. My expertise in creating wireframes and prototypes, along with my strong attention to detail, allows me to bring ideas to life and make a meaningful impact on user experiences.

I am excited to continue learning and applying the latest technologies to deliver innovative, user-centric solutions. Let’s connect and collaborate on projects that inspire and delight users!`
